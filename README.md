# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

A machine learning project designed to **detect fraudulent credit card transactions** using classification algorithms. This system addresses the challenge of **highly imbalanced datasets** and ensures robust fraud detection through effective **data preprocessing**, **resampling**, and **model evaluation techniques**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Download it using:

```python
import kagglehub

# Download the latest version
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud")
print("Path to dataset files:", path)
```

## 🔍 Features

### 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

* Removed missing values (none present)
* Dropped the `Time` column
* Scaled the `Amount` column using `StandardScaler`
* Removed duplicate rows

### 📉 Handling Imbalanced Data

* ✅ **Undersampling**
* ✅ **Oversampling** using **SMOTE**

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* Decision Tree

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Confusion Matrix
* ROC-AUC Curve
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### 📊 Visualization Tools

* `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` for data distribution, imbalance, and performance metrics

---

## 🔧 Project Pipeline

### 🔹 Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration

* Loaded with `pandas`
* Dataset shape: `(284,807 rows × 31 columns)`
* **Class Imbalance Detected**:

  * Normal Transactions: 275,190
  * Fraudulent Transactions: 473

### 🔹 Step 2: Preprocessing

* Dropped `Time` column
* Scaled `Amount` column
* Removed duplicates
* Final shape after cleaning: **(275,663 rows × 30 columns)**

### 🔹 Step 3: Visualization

* Class distribution visualized with `seaborn`
* Severe imbalance shown

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Initial Model Evaluation (Before Resampling)

### 🔸 Logistic Regression

* Accuracy: **99.92%**
* F1 Score: **0.719**
* Recall: **0.604** *(Recall is critical for fraud detection)*

### 🔸 Decision Tree

* Accuracy: **99.90%**
* F1 Score: **0.725**
* Recall: **0.769** *(Better recall than Logistic Regression)*

> ⚠️ Note: High accuracy is **misleading** due to class imbalance.

---

## ⚖️ Step 5: Data Balancing

### ✅ Undersampling

* Balanced Dataset:

  * 473 Fraud + 473 Normal
  * Total = **946 records**

---

## 🤖 Step 6: Model Evaluation (After Undersampling)

### 🔸 Logistic Regression

* Accuracy: **92.63%**
* Precision: **94.9%**
* Recall: **91.2%**
* F1 Score: **93.0%**

### 🔸 Decision Tree

* (Metrics similar or slightly better than Logistic Regression)

## ✅ Summary

| Model                      | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| -------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic (Imbalanced)      | 99.92%   | Low       | 60.4%  | 71.9%    |
| Decision Tree (Imbalanced) | 99.90%   | Low       | 76.9%  | 72.5%    |
| Logistic (Balanced)        | 92.63%   | 94.9%     | 91.2%  | 93.0%    |
